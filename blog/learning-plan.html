          <h2>My EDA Learning Plan</h2>
          <h3>Long term goals</h3>
          <p>
            My long term goal is to learn the skills and gather tools to become an independent web developer. By independent, I mean having the ability to make progress individually as a worker, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that I would work freelance or solo. I want to be capable within my own right. Ideally I’d work in a capacity where I could find stable work with the option of working remotely or with flexible hours. I’d love to do both front-end and back-end development and dabble in app creation too.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Learning - strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve always had a mind for numbers and logic. I used to feel at home following build instructions for Lego sets, but also loved thinking of a contraption and making it happen. My dream was to become an inventor. In some ways, web development is just that. I’ve always been able to maintain focus during work or learning, however this is countered by a tendency to self-doubt and procrastinate starting tasks.
          </p>

          <h3>What human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

          <p>
            Going overseas without a support network and living in a society where I was borderline illiterate really gave me some perspective of the importance of human skills. It also really highlighted the times where my human skills were sorely lacking (thanks to a great deal of time during my life spent in social comfort zones). In the end, through sheer necessity, I built a cast of friends (and new family!) and learned how to reach out. At Dev Academy, while I might not be in such a vulnerable position, I’d like to work on my communication and trust skills as part of a team. There are definite improvements in those areas I’m yet to make and I’m keen to get to work.
          </p>

          <h3>A commitment to manage:</h3>
          <p>
            To make the most of Dev Academy, and to be a member of the team, whether it be with peers, facilitators or other people I come in contact with as part of the course I need a set of personal guidelines.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To always be upfront and honest about my own contributions. This involves accurately reflecting on my personal progress day to day, and whether I have been truly challenging myself during my time.</li>
            <li>To engage in good faith and foster community. Remembering that the journey isn’t just about my learning, but the building of relationships with peers and others. The more at home we feel with each other, the easier it is to uplift one another. Part of this is to be empathetic and try to see where someone is coming from before responding.</li>
            <li>To enjoy the process. Everyone gets motivation from what they enjoy. While every step of the way won’t be rosy, I need to look for the silver linings as much as possible. Whether that’s seeing the humour in failures or just taking a break and laughing with peers.</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>
            As the third point suggests, I think the best course of action when things inevitably begin to build up and get to me is to simply create some distance from the issues. This needs to be structured so that I don’t fall into the trap of escapism. I think capping any major break to a day's time maximum gives a good baseline for being ready to jump back in. As the Swedes say: The pillow is the best advisor. 
          </p>
          
          
          <h3>A commitment to seek help:</h3>
          <p>
            The other obvious solution is to ask for help. I know I’m not alone, and sometimes some things need a team huddle to resolve. I’m prone to attempting to tough things out alone, worrying about being a bother for others. However, beyond a certain point, this isn’t productive. As a result, my resolve is to seek help from the appropriate source as soon as I realise it is beyond my ability to deal with alone. This needs to be whenever I get back to the problem after taking a time out to judge how I’m coping by myself. If schedules don’t quite match up with those I need help from, I will work on other things until the timing fits.
          </p>

          <h3>Expectations from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            It’s hard for me to expect, but there are some things that would be beneficial to count on. Perhaps the biggest help would be being attentive listeners to issues and providing constructive feedback or reasonable pointers to resources for solving things on my own.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Scheduling</h3>
          <p>
            I’m fortunate enough to be in a position to not have many home commitments that will take away my time, however I don’t wish to leave it all to my family. Outside of my course hours I will make sure to square away smaller responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            My brother is set to return for home isolation in March, so part of my responsibilities will be to block out time to pick him up from the airport, as well as help with making meals while he is isolated. I will communicate the details of this as soon as they are finalised.
          </p>

          <h2>My Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
          <h3>Long term goals</h3>
          <p>
            Furthering the career goals in my original Learning Plan, my life plans involve living in New Zealand and The United States at different points in time, so I would love to have a career which lets me be in either.
          </p>
          <h3>Bootcamp: strengths and limitatios</h3>
          <p>
            I think my biggest strengths will be my ability to focus, and willingness to work with my peers. Since starting foundations, I’ve gotten better at limiting self-doubt and procrastination, but I’m a little anxious about my ability to be fully present in the mornings. I often tend to be a night owl, but I have already arranged with another fellow night owl to hold each other accountable for our sleep schedules ahead of bootcamp.
          </p>
          <h3>Non-technical challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Probably the biggest non-technical challenge will be peer programming for me. I love the idea and absolutely want to work well in pairs, but I’m a little worried that it will be difficult to stay on the same page when it comes to actually programming. I’m used to collaborating in person, so online will be an experience. I think as we get to know each  other more it will come easier.
          </p>
          <h3>Human skills</h3>
          <p>
            I’d love to improve my communication abilities further throughout bootcamp. I’m good at listening, and explaining myself, given space and time, but feel like I’m most lacking in conversational ability. I’m hoping to build confidence by working together with my peers and facilitators consistently.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would also like to develop my leadership skills at the same time. While I don’t aim to always be in the lead, I want to be more reliable and confident in that position.
          </p>
          <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
          <p>
            I expect that the bootcamp team will keep an eye on my progress and well-being as well as provide constructive feedback throughout bootcamp. While I don’t think I’ll need any special considerations, I’m confident that I’ll be in good hands if something does come up.
          </p>
          <h3>Expectations from myself</h3>
          <p>
            From myself, I expect to stick with the strategies I’ve learned over foundations. Making sure to practice mindfulness and set myself up with a growth mind-set. I expect that I will adhere to my learning plan and as part of that be accountable for my level of attendance and effort. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest focus for me will be maintaining a healthy sleep schedule and being ready for every day. I will check in with my accountability group on time, and meet with my human skills facilitator to discuss the situation if it is an issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            To manage my time during the programme, I will stick to activity time slots and arrange with my family to complete family commitments outside of course time. I mentioned picking up my brother from the airport in my original learning plan. Thankfully, I'll be able to do that this week before bootcamp begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will take on board feedback during check-ins with facilitators to keep myself on track. With peers I will make an effort to communicate each day and be aware of their needs as well as my own. I want to be open and approachable day-to-day, and support them. I'll follow EDA policies and conduct guidelines as I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            My resolve for working productively with industry and community representatives is to put myself out there as much as I can manage. I will stay aware of times where I might be inclined to be shy, and take the initiative to reach out instead in a way that keeps my career goals in mind.
