        <h2>Javascript and The DOM</h2>
        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
          Probably the best way to later explain the <em>DOM</em> is to start by outlining <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>, which we use in creating websites. Let's imagine we are in a classroom, and we happen to be the principal of a school. There are many kinds of decisions we might want to make about how that school runs, and in a way those decisions are similar to how HTML and CSS function.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, in every classroom we have the all important students. Looking at just this classroom, we have prepared an attendance sheet. We know there will be 20 students in the class as well as their names in some kind of order. We also know that we have assigned Mrs Banner to this classroom to teach. We organised for a whiteboard to be in the classroom and for each student to have a desk and chair they sit in. These decisions, believe it or not, are similar to HTML. We know what's in our classroom, the same way HTML knows what's on a webpage. How many, what type and extra details like names to keep track. The content is what's important.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a webpage, CSS is in charge of the presentation. In our classroom, we want to set some rules for how things look, so that parents and members of the community see the value of our school. We might decide what color to paint the walls or whether to use plastic or wooden desks. Are desks in clusters or in a grid? How about the students. It's a bit messy for them to turn up in mufti every day. How about they wear a season-appropriate uniform? Of course, the teacher has presentation rules they need follow too. This is all styling, we create rules for presentation our class the same way CSS creates rules for presentation of a webpage.
        </p>
        <h3>The DOM</h3>
        <p>
          Continuing on with our earlier analogy, let's look at the DOM. However, this time we'll imagine we are Mrs Banner, the teacher. The principal might have decided the contents of the classroom and how it needs to look, but it's up to us to set some rules for smooth running day to day. We'll get back to this in a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>DOM</em> stands for <em>Document Object Model</em>. It's basically a certain way of looking at a webpage that allows for greater control. Everything on a web-page defined in HTML isn't just a mark-up to tell your browser what's what, they are actual objects!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thinking about our classroom, it isn't much of a revelation to say "those desks are objects". We know that. But for a webpage it opens up many possibilities. If we know every piece of the HTML Document is an object, we can manipulate those outside of the HTML. Change properties, define interactions etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you remember what your Year 1 teacher's rules were for going to the bathroom? Perhaps something like <code>1. Put your hand up.</code> <code>2. Wait for the teacher's acknowledgement.</code> <code>3. Go to the bathroom.</code> <code>4. Wash your hands.</code> <code>5. Come back to the rest of the class</code>. Your teacher didn't necessarily know who would want to go to the bathroom on any given day, but the procedure was well established, because there was a good possibility it would happen. That's exactly the way we want to use Javascript and the DOM.
