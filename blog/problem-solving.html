        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
        <h3>Getting Blocked</h3>
        <p>
          When I was in University, we were required to write a program to model a certain algorithm. I was certain my program was doing exactly what it was meant to according do the algorithm, but the result kept coming out wrong. Going through my code line by line I compared what it was doing to how I thought it should work. I asked my friends whether they could spot a mistake, but they said their solutions looked the same. I googled specific interactions between pieces of my code but found nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally all this was frustrating. I thought perhaps I was being punished for not being lucky, or smart enough to just "get it". When I eventually did find the issue (I set some variables to 0 instead of 1), it was almost a face to palm moment.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <p>
            Sometimes, despite our best efforts we just can't work out how to solve a problem. We are blocked. It can seem like no matter how much thinking we do, we can't get our head around it. That may make us feel stupid or inadequate, but the answer shouldn't be to give up on ourselves.
          </p>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I realised that it wasn't my fault or anyone else's that I had encountered the problem, I just needed to be a little more careful with the techniques I used to solve it. I knew the math in theory needed variables with initial values of 1, but because it wasn't written in the algorithm, I didn't notice as I checked the algorithm against my code. In other words, I wasn't exploring the full picture in my step-by-step analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>Elegant Solution</h3>
        <p>
          I used to enter programming competitions with my friends every year for a bit of fun. While I wasn't nearly as good at solving problems as the other guys, I still found ways to contribute.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Often in a competition there are difficult problems and simple problems to solve worth points proportional to difficulty. Normally you get a limited number of attempts at solving a problem, and the less attempts you take, the more points you gain. Most of the time the faster your solution runs, the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our team, we decided the really brilliant members would focus all their efforts on the biggest problems, while the rest of us worked through as many simple problems as possible to pad our team's score. One particular problem I'm proud of solving asked us to read a document, output some information, and then re-read the document to find all the matches to what we had output. This kind of problem normally requires a slow running solution. I was hesitant about being able to solve it in time.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <p>
            Consciously planning before going about solving a problem can reduce the need to make attempts and then back-track things that just don't work. We can use techniques like pseudocoding to step through a problem mentally before even beginning to write a solution.
          </p>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I sat down after reading the problem brief and began to think about all of the cases where I would need to output something from my program. Writing these down in a list, I realised they were so similar I wouldn't need to read the document twice. I could just read it once in a very particular fashion. A shortcut! This completely changed how fast our solution would run. I wrote some pseudocode for how I thought it should go and quickly ran the solution by my other teammate. Then I got to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we submitted our solution, it not only had it passed on the first try, but it was the first pass for that question and eventually was the fastest running solution out of all the teams. I was really proud. My initial hesitation over my ability completely disappeared, and I realised that it was thanks to careful planning that I identified the short-cut and an extra pair of eyes to confirm I hadn't made any mistakes. It might have been a simple problem, but to me it affirmed my value to the team.

        <h3>Techniques and Processes</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different ways to go about solving problems. Some involve thinking about the logic of a program in a specific way, others help you get unstuck when you hit a block. To me, it is useful to think of the scenario I might use a given technique, so for this section, I will use the tags <code class="tag-blue">logic</code> and <code class="tag-orange">debugging</code> to note that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Useful methods (in the order I like to use them):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><h6><a href="#m1">Pseudocode</a></h6> <code class="tag-blue">logic</code></li>
          <li><h6><a href="#m2">Trying something</a></h6> <code class="tag-blue">logic</code> <code class="tag-orange">debugging</code></li>
          <li><h6><a href="#m3">Console.logging</a></h6> <code class="tag-orange">debugging</code></li>
          <li><h6><a href="#m4">Reading error messages</a></h6> <code class="tag-orange">debugging</code></li>
          <li><h6><a href="#m5">Googling</a></h6> <code class="tag-blue">logic</code> <code class="tag-orange">debugging</code></li>
          <li><h6><a href="#m6">Rubber Ducky Method</a></h6> <code class="tag-blue">logic</code> <code class="tag-orange">debugging</code></li>
          <li><h6><a href="#m7">Asking your peers for help</a></h6> <code class="tag-blue">logic</code> <code class="tag-orange">debugging</code></li>
          <li><h6><a href="#m8">Asking your coaches for help</a></h6> <code class="tag-blue">logic</code> <code class="tag-orange">debugging</code></li>
          <li><h6><a href="#m9">Improving your process with reflection</a></h6> <code class="tag-blue">logic</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="m1">Pseudocode <code class="tag-blue">logic</code></h4>
        <p>
          Many people naturally begin to plan the steps they will take when they encounter a problem. The aim with Pseudocode is to break a problem down into much smaller steps in plain English. It allows us to solidify those steps into actionable snippets as well as provide us with a reminder of what we are trying to do whenever we step away, or even get lost in the details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          Commenting your code before you start can help keep each piece of code nicely segmented and simple. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a pseudocode block for reference can remind you of the overall flow of your program.
